The system automatically detects and classifies HABSIs. **Results:** In this study, the number of computer-detected HABSIs correlated closely with the number of HABSIs detected by ICP by department (n=20; r=.999 P<.001) and by time (n=14; r=.941; P<.001). Compared with reference standards, this system performed excellently with regard to sensitivity (98.16%), specificity (99.96%), positive predictive value (95.81%), and negative predictive value (99.98%). The system enabled decreasing the delay in confirmation of HABSI cases, on average, by 29 days. **Conclusions:** This system provides reliable and objective HABSI data for quality indicators, improving the delay caused by a conventional surveillance system.\"\nabstract_short = \"This system provides reliable and objective HABSI data for quality indicators, improving the delay caused by a conventional surveillance system.\"\nauthors = [\"Tseng YJ\",\"Wu JH\", \"Lin HC\", \"Chen MY\", \"Ping XO\", \"Sun CC\", \"Shang RJ\", \"Sheng WH\", \"Chen YC\", \"Lai F\", \"Chang SC\"]\ndate = \"2015-09-18\"\nimage_preview = \"HABSI.png\"\nmath = true\npublication_types = [\"2\"]\npublication = \"In *JMIR Medical Inforamtics*.\"\npublication_short = \"In *JMIR Med Inform*.\"\nselected = false\ntitle = \"Development and Evaluation of a Web-Based, Hospital-Wide Healthcare-Associated Bloodstream Infection Surveillance and Classification System\"\nurl_code = \"\"\nurl_dataset = \"\"\nurl_pdf = \"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Yi_Ju_Tseng/publication/282149821_A_Web-Based_Hospital-Wide_Health_Care-Associated_Bloodstream_Infection_Surveillance_and_Classification_System_Development_and_Evaluation/links/5615356808aed47facefb9ce/A-Web-Based-Hospital-Wide-Health-Care-Associated-Bloodstream-Infection-Surveillance-and-Classification-System-Development-and-Evaluation.pdf?_iepl%5BhomeFeedViewId%5D=pJC0WEKQK5UGhRWx5xGPD1Fr&_iepl%5Bcontexts%5D%5B0%5D=pcfhf&_iepl%5BinteractionType%5D=publicationDownload&origin=publication_detail&ev=pub_int_prw_xdl&msrp=UtmKRfJ84yoVZYbpyRbZF5hbzc3qtiUCLGAD9tx_wk1WS0_IoqfdLwIkz6rNFPmSiPS618lj9p7ZlC2cwldtjCcU9v3N2dZcJ8tHUZMKMpuVQTbFT7tofZE2.KHeGkV0qOSLsTRx9cJLtdl0sSCHZoOOztioLZhNxlTvrjNAeV84Qj708OkrB-904i3jsLEjNBaGqeHFgZyRQG1Rh-Og8ZZN0WGFZ1A.I1f2EM0HN7xZdswwe5TfxmjPXiHU4pNnUWQ6h-01XpjWB9QUC0p57kRzz6xwT2wTpmxzIXxJAxSp-rdvVyV3kHgVtPGA2fmzuf1WzQ.4H7ixJBbfhiSg3w-5hFI6Tf6vNfUeNBFsm31sJGyIxxS5I6c7Okh45uhW_xoDZ6tsrXse4iQrMNd2dXqIhb7KHzurX8PnPYbPB2fLA\"\nurl_project = \"\"\nurl_slides = \"\"\nurl_video = \"\"\n\n+++\n",
